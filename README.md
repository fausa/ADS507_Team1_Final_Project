# ADS507_Team1_Final_Project
## Effects of Weather on Domestic Air Travel  

### Description:
Place to collaborate on a project that will take a dataset and build either an ETL or ELT pipeline to produce a practical output from it. Examples would be a triggered email from a condition that is met, or a dashboard to visualize the data.

### Objective:
To analyze domestic air travel cancellations/delays due to weather conditions at the departure city or destination city based on a few datasets that could illustrate the particulars of weather that cause the most delays/cancellations, or if there are other factors like Airline, aircraft model, or simply busy terminals that can contribute more to these issues. Our project will be to output a visualization of these variables perhaps on an interactive map of the country with options to look at the data on a monthly basis or compare airlines/weather conditions. 

### Datasets:
1.  Airline.sql database
2.  Airports.csv
3.  WeatherEvents_Jan2016-Dec2021.csv

### Schema (in progress):
* Extraction:
* Transform:
* Load:

### Code (in progress):
* SQL schema development
* Pipeline development
* Python dashboard development

### Output:
